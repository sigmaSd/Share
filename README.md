## How it works

Share supports **bidirectional file transfer** - you can both send and receive
files:

### ðŸ“¤ **Sharing Mode** (Send files to others)

1. Drop a file or paste content into the app
2. A QR code is generated containing your local server's URL
3. Others scan the QR code to download your files through their web browser
4. For files, they get a direct download link
5. For directories, they see a browsable directory listing
6. For text content, they see the text directly in their browser

### ðŸ“¥ **Receive Mode** (Receive files from others)

1. Click "Receive Mode" or press `Ctrl+R`
2. Share the QR code with others
3. They scan it and get an upload interface in their web browser
4. They can drag & drop files/folders or click to browse and select
5. Files are automatically saved to your Downloads folder (configurable)

**Key Features:**

- **No additional software needed** - just a QR code scanner and web browser
- **Directory support** - Upload/download entire folder structures
- **Multiple file uploads** - Batch upload many files at once (receive mode)
- **Local network only** - All transfers happen locally, no internet required
